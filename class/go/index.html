<p>This couse is suitable for kids with some level of programming experience, such
as Python, Scratch or other language. Students should be familiar with basic
computer functions, such as downloading and opening files. There will be typing
involved. Before first class please have the following software installed:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/dl">Go 1.8</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/download">Git</a></li>
<li><em>Optional - <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download">NotePad++</a></em></li>
</ul>

<p>Going over <a href="https://try.github.io">Github&rsquo;s Git Tutorial</a> would help you
