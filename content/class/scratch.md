# Scratch
Scratch is a programming language and an online community where children can
program and share interactive media such as stories, games, and animation with
people from all over the world. As children create with Scratch, they learn to
think creatively, work collaboratively, and reason systematically.

While Scratch is primarily designed for 8 to 16 year olds, it is also used by
people of all ages, including younger children with their parents.
