# Go

### Course Times:
Spring 2017 session: 11:00 - 13:00

In this course we will explore the world of Go, free, fast, easy to learn
language very similar to Python. We will be making basic chatbots - programs
which will respond to what you write in chat

This couse is suitable for kids with some level of programming experience, such
as Python, Scratch or other language. Students should be familiar with basic
computer functions, such as downloading and opening files. There will be typing
involved. Before first class please have the following software installed:

- [Go 1.8](https://golang.org/dl)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download)
- *Optional - [Atom](https://atom.io) or [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download)*

Going over [Github's Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io) would help you
understand Git, which will be used to save and share your code.
