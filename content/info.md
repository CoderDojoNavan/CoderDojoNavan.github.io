# INFORMATION

__CoderDojo Navan__ is a cool, free environment where kidfs can learn how to
program, build wbesites, animated characters and games with different software
programs and languages.

All the mentors are volunteers who either teach or work in IT, and our aim is
to help you develop the skills you want to learn.

We will now be holding our Dojo sessions for  6 consecutive Sataurdays for a 2
hour session during a 4 hour window; 11:00 - 15:00 each week, instead of once
a month. The actual times have been determined by the mentor leading each
particular class. Therefore some classes will be 11:00 - 13:00, others
12:00-14:00 and some 13:00 - 15:00

Given the volunteer nature of the Dojo, it is requested that those signing up
for a course, do so with the intention of attending all 6 Saturdays in
recognition of the time being given by our volunteer mentors. The students
that attend all dates will then be awarded a course completion certificate.

As well as 'Scratch', which is the coding for beginners and younger students,
we are now offering the following more advanced courses specifically targeting
older kids that have perhaps attended in the past or are self-taught and wish
to broaden their skills in any of the following areas:

* __Website Design__ - Do you have a hobby or want to share your interests?
  Then share these and more on your very own website. Learn how to create web
	pages in HTML and design each page using CSS for layouts, fonts, colours etc.
	With this knowledge you can then build and share your website on the web.
* __User Interface (UI) Design__ - Bring your app, game or web page to life by
  creating graphical user interfaces that engage and inspire people. Users need
	to feel comfortable with the system they are using and it needs to respond
	accordingly, i.e. buttons should behave like buttons and aliens should
	wiggle. Using free tools like Inkscape and GIMP, learn to take your blank
	canvas and put your ideas to life in a way that people enjoy.
* __Python__ - Want to create a new gaming experience by exploring the magical
  world of Minecraft programming? You've probably breaten the creepers,
	travelled deep into caves and maybe even gone to The End and back - but have
	you ever transformed a sword into a magic wand? Build a palace in a blink of
	an eye? Designed to own colour-changing disco dance floor? Learn to do this
	and and more in Minecraft with the power of Python!
* __Dev Ops__ - (Development/Operations) - All websites sit on servers and
  DevOps are the people who put up and manage the websites online. Learn to use
	tools for controlling the website code/web app using Git, deploying code to
	servers, using Linux, server administration and open source and its benefits.
	All to ensure that your website stays online and is easy to maintain.

For all courses except 'Scratch', students should already be familiar with
basic computer functions including downloading, opening files, saving
information to different locations and basic keyboard skills.

There will be limited space for each course. Our regulars and those on the
waiting list shall be contacted by emails over the comming days with any
available places thereafter announced here.

If you are interested in any taking part or if you are interested in mentoring
or offering your skills as a speaekr to a class for a once off workshop on
specialized software (such as Photoshop, AutoCAD, etc.) or hardware workshop,
please email us on coderdojonavan@gmail.com
